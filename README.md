## Abstract

We introduce Rohbau3D, a novel dataset of 3D point clouds that realistically represent indoor construction environments. The dataset comprises 504 high-resolution LiDAR scans captured with a terrestrial laser scanner across 14 distinct construction sites, including residential buildings, a large-scale office complex, educational facilities, and an underground parking garageâ€”all in various stages of shell construction or renovation. Each point cloud is enriched with scalar laser reflectance intensity, RGB color values, and reconstructed surface normal vectors. In addition to the 3D data, the dataset includes high-resolution 2D panoramic renderings of each scene and its associated point cloud features. Designed to reflect the complexity and variability of real-world construction sites, Rohbau3D supports research in geometric processing, scene understanding, and intelligent computing in structural and civil engineering. To our knowledge, it is the first dataset of its kind and scale to be publicly released. Rohbau3D is intended as a foundation for ongoing work, with plans to extend it through additional scenes and targeted annotations to support future research.

## Data Records

The Rohbau3D data records can be summarized as a medium-scale repository of terrestrial laser scan point clouds covering static scenes from a wide variety of shell construction sides. The records include the spatial coordinates annotated with the sensor-specific (1) RGB color, (2) surface reflection intensity information, (3) the reconstruction of surface normal vectors, and (4) panoramic 2D image representations of all feature spaces


### The Scope Of The Data

The repository contains in total a set of 504 scenes captured in one of 14 different building environments.


File ID    | Acquisition Site Overview

site_010\* | Vaulted cellar of brick structure. Small rooms. Uneven floors. Poor lighting.
site_011   | Two-story structure with basement. Mixed brick and precast concrete construction. Small to medium rooms. Water on floors. Poor lighting.
site_012   | Multi-story apartment block with basement. Reinforced concrete prefabricated construction. Large window and door openings. Some scenes contain water on the floor and show poor lighting.
site_013\* | Multi-story brick building under renovation. Small rooms connected by corridors. Walls partly plastered, partly exposed. Mostly clean floors.

## Download and Extract the Data 

The Dataset can be directly downloaded in chunks from Dataverse | OpenData UniBw M:

> Download Link: [https://open-data.unibw.de/dataset](https://open-data.unibw.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.60776/ZWJFI4)

Conveniently, this repository offers also the option of downloading the entire dataset or individual pieces using scripts. [**RECOMMENDED**]



- **Short Version:**
  
  Inside the `Rohbau3D` folder, run the `scripts/download.py` script to download all dataset point cloud files. 
  
  ```bash
  python scripts/download.py --config config/dataverse.yaml --download --extract
  ```
  **Options:** 
  - `--config` [required] : set the path to the configuration script. 
  - `--download` [optional] : Flag to enable download. Default=False. 
  - `--extract` [optional] : Flag to enable file extraction. Default=True.

 
- **Manual Configuration:**

    Customize the configuration inside the `config/dataverse.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    # CONFIGURATION
